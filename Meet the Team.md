### Meet the Team

We have a great group of experts working to meet your needs.

#### Trish Urdzik, CEO and Senior Researcher 

For over a decade, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with a diverse array of clients, from non-profits and government agencies to private corporations and academic institutions. I enjoy addressing issues of entrepreneurs and start-ups as much as Fortune 300 companies - maybe more! Their projects span sectors including healthcare, education, business, and community development.

My extensive work and continuing professional education has taken me to various corners of the globe, allowing me to gain understanding and surface insights firsthand into pain points and opportunities faced by organizations of different sizes, in different communities with different cultures and priorities. I have a passion for understanding the intersections between people, technology, and culture. I leverage that passion to surface insights and recommendations to help organizations and communities navigate complex challenges and achieve their goals..

**Trish Urdzik** is an independent consultant specializing in applied anthropology. 

With a deep passion for understanding human behavior, cultures, and societies, I leverage anthropological insights to help organizations and communities navigate complex social challenges and achieve their goals. With a passion for understanding the complexities of human behavior, culture, and social interactions, I bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake.

### My Background

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that span across various sectors including healthcare, education, business, and community development. For more than a decade, I have worked with a diverse array of clients, from non-profits and government agencies to private corporations and academic institutions. 

My extensive fieldwork and research have taken me to various corners of the globe, allowing me to immerse myself in different cultures and gain firsthand insights into the challenges and opportunities they face.

### My Approach

I believe in a holistic and participatory approach to problem-solving. By involving community members and stakeholders in the research process, I ensure that the solutions we develop are grounded in real-world experiences and are sustainable in the long run. 

My work is guided by principles of empathy, respect, and a commitment to social justice. At the core of my work is the belief that understanding people— their motivations, behaviors, and environments—is essential to creating effective and sustainable solutions. 

I employ a range of anthropological methods, including ethnographic research, participant observation, and qualitative interviews, to gather deep, actionable insights. My approach is holistic, considering the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts that influence individual and group behaviors.

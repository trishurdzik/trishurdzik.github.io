Do you need a specialist in human-centered business solutions with a personal touch? Look no further! Iâ€™ve conducted a wide range of ethnographic research and quantitative analysis for a variety of organizations, including Fortune 300 companies, colleges, a medical practice conglomerate, a medical research organization, small businesses, and start-ups. 

With a passion for understanding the complexities and intersection of human behavior, culture, and social interactions, I bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake. I leverage insights to help organizations and communities navigate complex challenges and achieve their goals. 

### My Background

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that span across various sectors including healthcare, education, business, and community development. For more than a decade, I have worked with a diverse array of clients, from non-profits and government agencies to private corporations and academic institutions. 

My extensive work has taken me to various corners of the globe, allowing me to immerse myself in different cultures and gain firsthand insights into the pain points and opportunities they face. 

### My Approach

My skills toolbox includes a broad range of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Since every organization is unique, I use best-fitmethods to gatrher deep, actionable, and,most importantly, feasible insights. My approach is holistic, considering the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts that influence individual and group behaviors.

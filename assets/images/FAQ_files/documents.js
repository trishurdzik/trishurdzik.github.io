  "body": "Have questions? We have answers! I'm establishing, or want to establish, a research team at my organization. Can I get guidance on what to do, who to look for, etc? Of course! We love to help organizations grow and would be honored to be a part of your growth. Scaling up can be overwhelming but it's a sign that your organization is on the right track. Let us help you figure out exactly what your organization needs and the best way to obtain it with the resources you have available. Setting up ethical guidelines, security practices, establishing best practices, and hiring the right people to keep that going can be done by our experts as well. Reach out if you'd like guidance or if you'd like to talk about Critical Path putting all those processes in place for you. I already have UX designers that conduct research. Why would they need research training? A designer with both research and design responsibilities means that the UXD has to spread themselves between the two. Would you hire a UX researcher and expect them to know how to design? Why not? They can pick up things on the internet using blogs and YouTube videos, right? Well, that would be silly, wouldn't it? Designers go through training to ensure that they XXXXX. Because of this, you have total confidence in their ability to XXXX. Likewise, although a designer may pick up research techniques, someone who is trained in best-fit methodologies and XXXX will ensure that you get the results you need to ensure that your organization is staying on track and help it move forward into the future. What's the difference between a workshop and a seminar? Don't each of them talk about the same topic? At Critical Path, we believe in tailoring every experience to your unique needs. When it comes to our learning experiences, we offer both workshops and seminars—each designed to help you level up, but with a playful twist and different flavors of engagement. This is especially applicable to how you'd like your team to receive information. Seminars: The big-picture experience. Great for stand-alone topics or as an introduction to workshop practical skill building. What to Expect in a Seminar: Insightful Presentations: Our expert will share the why behind the trends, diving into topics with clear, strategic narratives. Real-World Examples: We'll illustrate our points with entertaining case studies—think of it as learning from both the triumphs and the hilarious missteps of others. Interactive Q&amp;A: While the format is mostly lecture-style, there's plenty of time to ask your burning questions and get quick, insightful answers. Large Audience Vibes: Perfect for when you need to educate a broad group—be it your entire company or a community of industry professionals. Workshops: Interactive activities and group collaboration to learn and practice skills in real time. What to Expect in a Workshop: Interactive Activities: You'll participate in role-playing exercises, group challenges, hands-on sessions designed to practice new skills, etc. Real-Time Problem Solving: We work on your specific challenges, crafting solutions that are tailored to your business. It’s all about practice, feedback, and iteration. Small Group Setting: Workshops are intimate, ensuring personalized guidance and plenty of opportunities for everyone to contribute. Practical Takeaways: By the end of a workshop, you'll have learned practical skills or perhaps created actionable plans to be implemented in your business. Which One Is Right for You? Choose a Seminar When: You need a big-picture perspective and strategic insights. Your goal is to educate a large group quickly and uniformly. You're looking for information and without diving too deep or having hands-on practice. Choose a Workshop When: You need to actively engage your team in practical exercises to solidify skills. You want to solve specific problems and craft tailored solutions. Your focus is on skill-building and application in a collaborative, interactive setting. At Critical Path, whether you opt for a seminar or a workshop, our goal is to make learning engaging, fun, and most importantly—personalized to your business needs. Ready to pick your adventure and transform your team's skills? Let's chat and design the perfect experience for you! {} { data =&gt;true} Can I get ongoing support? We would be honored to act as your trusted advisor. Ongoing support is ideal when you and/or your team need access to Apex experts for guidance outside of a specific project. In these cases, we would talk about setting up a retainer. By utilizing a retainer, you'll be able to talk to an expert on any issue via your preferred method of communication. The retainer is based on your specific needs, so reach out and let's chat about what works for you (and your team). I already have an idea of the research I want to do. Can I just get your opinion? Yes! Whether you're an established business, a start-up, or a student looking for professional advice, we'd be happy to be your sounding board. Reach out and let's chat about setting up a one-to-one with an Apex expert! When is a training series better than a single workshop, seminar, etc.? FOO Do you perform 360 reviews? (Also known as 360-degree feedback or multi-source feedback) Yes! Whether due to fear of reprisals, ambivilence that their opinions will be given serious consideration, or other reasons, many employees won't give honest feedback regarding the leadership or others that they interact with. We pride ourselves on ethical practices and ensuring employee anonymity and confidentiality is an crucial part of that. You can count on us to gather feedback discretely and with full anonymity and confidentiality. We'll then present the information and any recommendations to you with sensitivity. Our organization needs to gather feedback from our employees but many people won't give their honest opinion because they're afraid it won't be confidential or anonymous. Can you help? Yes! Wehther due to fear of reprisals, ambivilence that their opinions will be given serious consideration, or other reasons, many employees won't give honest opinions on engagement surveys or feedback regarding leadership at their companies. We pride ourselves on ethical practices and ensuring employee anonymity and confidentiality is an crucial part of that. Using your input, Critical Path will use best-fit methods to determine how your feedback should be collected. Then you just leave it to us to collect the needed information and report findings, which include our recommendations moving forward."

  "title": "Case Study: Discovery Research for a Boston Bike Trails App",
  "body": "This case study highlights the critical role of market research in guiding strategic decisions in app development and the potential consequences of not heeding expert recommendations. Read to end for my reflections. Background and Scope I was hired by a tech start-up in Boston to conduct discovery research to assess the market viability of an app designed to show users all the different bike trails in and around the city. The goal was to determine if there was a demand for such an app and identify any unique gaps that the app could fill. The start-up requested that the work (proposal, research, analysis, presentation of recommendations) be completed within 4 weeks of the date they contacted me. However, after careful consideration of the project scope and objectives as well as methodologies needed to gather the data needed, I determined that the work could not be done within the time frame they requested. I met with the client again and discussed with them a more realistic timeframe that would ensure they had the data needed in order to make an informed decision on going forward with app development and implementation. Methodologies The following best-fit methodologies were utilized in order to gather comprehensive insights: Competitive Analysis What: I analyzed existing apps that provided information on bike trails in Boston. This included evaluating app features, user reviews, download statistics, and overall market presence. Why: To understand the current landscape of similar apps available in the market. Contextual Analysis What: I observed how bikers in Boston use current apps and navigational tools during their rides. This included field observations and noting the real-time use of technology on popular bike trails. Why: To gain a deeper understanding of the biking environment and user interactions with existing solutions. Participatory Observation What: participated in several biking events and regular bike commutes, engaging with the biking community and observing their behavior and needs. Why: To experience first-hand the biking culture and the challenges faced by bikers in Boston. One-on-One Interviews What: conducted in-depth interviews with individuals who bike regularly in and around Boston. The questions focused on their current use of apps, pain points, and unmet needs related to biking. Why: To gather qualitative data from regular bikers about their experiences and needs. Findings and Recommendations Market Saturation: The competitive analysis revealed that the market for bike trail apps in Boston was already saturated with well-established apps offering detailed trail information, real-time updates, and community features. Lack of Unique Value Proposition: Contextual analysis and participatory observation indicated that existing apps sufficiently met the needs of bikers. There were no significant gaps or unmet needs that a new app could uniquely address. User Feedback: Interviews with bikers reinforced the findings that the existing apps were highly rated and commonly used. Users did not express a strong desire for additional features that were not already available in current offerings. Based on the findings above, I reported to the client that entering the market with the bike trail app in its current ideation would likely be unsuccessful. The recommendation was to explore alternative app ideas that could offer a unique value proposition or address an unmet need within the biking community or another target market. Client’s Decision and Outcome Despite the well-documented findings and strategic recommendation, the client decided to proceed with the original plan to develop and launch the bike trail app. The app was launched but failed to gain traction in the market. The saturation of similar apps and the lack of differentiation led to poor user adoption and ultimately, the app was not successful. Reflections As the consultants’ proverb goes, “you can lead a client to a great recommendation but you can’t make them act on it”. My multi-faceted approach provided clear evidence that the market was not viable for the proposed app. The client decided to proceed against recommendations and this resulted in an unsuccessful product launch. As frustrating as this is when it happens, whether or not the client implements the recommendation(s) is not a reflection of the quality of work performed, nor a personal slight. Because I practice letting go after the work is complete, what the client decides to do with the insights doesn’t affect my sense of worth or pride in my work."

  "title": "Emotional Challenges in Consultancy: When a Client Disregards Recommendations",
  "body": " 2024/08/01 - Working as a consultant can be challenging, especially when you spend a lot of time and effort on a project only to have your client ignore your recommendations. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and even grief. Here’s a detailed, easy-to-understand guide on how to deal with these emotions. For an example from one of my own projects, head over to Boston Biking Trails App. Understanding Why It Hurts When you invest a lot in a project, it’s natural to feel attached to it. We often put our heart and soul into our work, so when a client decides not to follow our advice, it can feel like a personal rejection. Understanding why you feel this way is the first step to dealing with it. Step 1: Recognize Your Feelings First, it’s important to acknowledge your feelings. Understand that it’s normal to feel upset or frustrated. Don’t try to ignore these emotions; instead, accept them as a natural and valid response. Mindfulness: Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts and feelings without judgment. When feeling anger, frustration, or another emotion, take a moment to simply acknowledge what you’re feeling. Name the emotion(s) and remind yourself that they are normal. Then practice letting the emotion(s) go. If you’re interested, practicing mindfulness techniques like meditation, deep-breathing exercises, or simply taking a moment to sit quietly and focus on your breathing can help you stay calm and aware of your emotions. Step 2: Look at the Situation Differently Try to see the situation from another perspective. Instead of seeing the client’s decision as a rejection of you or your work, view it as part of the business process where many factors influence decisions. This can help you detach emotionally and see the bigger picture. Turn It Around: Focus on the skill(s) you developed/honed and the knowledge you gained during the project. Every project helps you grow professionally, regardless of the outcome. For example, think about how this project improved your research skills or how you can use the insights you gained in future projects. Step 3: Talk to Someone Who Understands Sharing your feelings with friends, colleagues, or a professional counselor can be very helpful. Talking to others who understand your field can provide comfort and new insights. Don’t be surprised if they also have encountered the same or similar situations. We cannot go it alone and thrive. Professional Groups: Join professional networks or support groups where you can share experiences and get advice. For instance, attending monthly meetups with similar entrepreneurs can provide a platform to discuss challenges and learn from each other’s experiences. Check your local Chamber of Commerce for their meetings or a list of local professional organizations for small businesses. Many groups also meet virtually, making it easier to get the support we need. Step 4: Make Sure You Have Realistic Expectations From the beginning, you make sure to set realistic expectations with your clients. Remind yourself that while you provide recommendations, it’s up to them to decide what to do. Review Your Agreements: Remind yourself that your recommendations are suggestions, not obligations. Remember that most of us include a clause in our contracts that outlines our responsibility to provide informed recommendations and that implementing them is at the client’s discretion. Step 5: Focus on What You Can Control Feeling frustrated and angry often comes from a sense of losing control. It’s only natural that you would expect your insights to be recognized and implemented, however, we cannot force our clients to do what research says is best. Focus on what you can control, such as the quality of your work and how you present your recommendations. Be Proud of Competent Work Products: Ensuring that your work is always top-notch will give you a sense of accomplishment and control over your efforts. Things you can control would include, double-checking your reports for accuracy and clarity, making sure your presentations are well-prepared and engaging, etc. Step 6: Be Kind to Yourself It’s important to practice self-compassion. Understand that frustrations such as these are a part of a consultant’s life and treat yourself kindly during these times. Ask yourself: would you talk to a friend the way you’re talking to yourself? Don’t beat yourself up over things that are out of your control. Self-Reflection: Take time to reflect on what went well and acknowledge the hard work you put in. Using a notepad, Google doc, et., to keep track of your successes, whether personal or professional. This is where you write down your achievements and positive experiences to remind yourself of your strengths and progress when you experience disappointment in the future. It’s especially helpful to keep records of praise you’ve received from various clients. Step 7: Only Revisit After a Break Take a break away from the project before revisiting it with the client. Feedback: Ask for feedback to understand the client’s decision better. For example, request a debrief meeting with the client to discuss what they felt worked and what didn’t, and, if applicable, use this information to refine your future strategies. Conclusion As I understand too well, when a client doesn’t follow your advice, it can be emotionally challenging. By recognizing and accepting your feelings, looking at the situation from a new perspective, talking to others, focusing on what you can control, being kind to yourself, learning from the experience, and setting realistic expectations, you can learn to anticipate and manage these emotions. These steps can help you stay strong and resilient in your consultancy career, ensuring that you continue to provide value while maintaining your emotional well-being."

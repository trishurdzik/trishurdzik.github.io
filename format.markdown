<p class="card-text">Workshops are ideal for groups of 3 or more people because they invorporate hands-on activities under the supervision on an expert. </p>
<p class="card-text">Workshops also create the ideal atmosphere for conflict resolutions. Do you feel that there's a lack of communication in your organization? Perhaps internal surveys have uncovered employee dissatisfaction? Workshops can help uncover possible solutions.</p>
  <p class="card-text"><strong>Who is this for?</strong>
  <ul>

  **Skills Training**: Skills workshops can be stand-alone or a series of skills modules for democratization across teams. Workshops are an efficient way for non-researchers to learn basic skills or get an in-depth understanding of those they currently use. Participants will not only learn how to use a skill, but as importantly, when to use the skill - best-fit methodology. You can perform the skill perfectly, but if it's not appropriate for the project you're working on you will not get the data you need to solve your product/service question and grow your business. 

  **Product or Service Management Planning**: Projects live and fail due to planning. Do you have a guideline for planning? Who is included? Are you anticipating things that can derail your project roadmap or do you try to deal with them as they arise? These workshops can teach you how to anticipate and troubleshoot before they occur.

  **Internal Solutioning**: Are you surprised by the results of employee satisfaction surveys? Do you notice communication or other issues between teams that need to work together? Internal solutioning workshops bring together individuals in an environment where they feel free to discuss concerns and discover solutions that will be implemented in the short- and long-term.

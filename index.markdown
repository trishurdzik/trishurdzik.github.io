Choosing the right consultant can make all the difference. Here are a few reasons why clients choose to work with me:

**Expertise**: With a solid academic foundation and over a decade of practical, applied experience, I am able to leverage both industry best practices as well as the myriad of skills in my toolbox to create best-fit plans for the project at hand. Using this experience, I  am able to pivot quickly and smoothly with changing stakeholder needs.

**Tailored Solutions**: I understand that no two projects are the same. I work closely with clients to develop customized strategies that address their specific needs, ensuring that the recommendations produced are relevant, impactful, and, most importantly, feasible.

**Holistic Perspective**: My anthropological lens ensures that all solutions are grounded in a deep understanding of the ways in which historical, economic, cultural, and social contexts affect human behavior and lead to the usage (or not) of client policies, products, or services.

**Commitment to Positive, Ethical Impact**: I am dedicated to making a positive impact through my work, whether itâ€™s improving user experiences, informing policy, or fostering community development while adhering to the highest ethical standards. These standards are based on industry best practices established by the [Society for Applied Anthropology Statement of Ethics and Professional Responsibilities](https://www.appliedanthro.org/annual-meeting/meeting-information/statement-ethics).

**Collaborative Spirit**: I work closely with stakeholders, their team, and the communities with which they work to foster an environment of trust and mutual respect.

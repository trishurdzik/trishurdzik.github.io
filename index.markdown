Choosing the right consultant can make all the difference. Here are a few reasons why clients choose to work with me:

**Expertise**: With a solid academic foundation and over a decade of practical, applied experience, I am able to leverage both industry best practices as well as the myriad of skills in my toolbox to create best-fit plans for the project at hand. Using this experience, I  am able to pivot quickly and smoothly with changing stakeholder needs.

**Tailored Solutions**: No two projects are the same. I work closely with clients to develop customized strategies that address their specific needs, ensuring that the recommendations produced are relevant, impactful, and, most importantly, feasible.xxxxxxx

**Holistic Perspective**: My anthropological lens ensures that all solutions are grounded in a deep understanding of the ways in which historical, economic, cultural, and social contexts affect human behavior and lead to the usage (or not) of client policies, products, or services.

**Commitment to Positive, Ethical Impact**: I am dedicated to making a positive impact through my work, whether it’s improving user experiences, informing policy, or fostering community development while adhering to the highest ethical standards. These standards are based on industry best practices established by the [Society for Applied Anthropology Statement of Ethics and Professional Responsibilities](https://www.appliedanthro.org/annual-meeting/meeting-information/statement-ethics).

**Collaborative Spirit**: I work closely with stakeholders, their team, and the communities with which they work to foster an environment of trust and mutual respect.

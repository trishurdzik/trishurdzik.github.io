At **Critical Paths**, we know the best solutions aren’t hiding in spreadsheets or buried in code—they come from understanding *people*. Founded by an applied anthropologist with years of field experience, we specialize in **human-centered consulting** that goes beyond theory. Whether you’re troubleshooting workplace culture, designing a new system, or rolling out change, we help businesses, organizations, and communities create strategies that actually work—**in real life, not just on paper**. 

### **Why Applied Anthropologists Are the Secret Weapon Behind Human-Centered Solutions**  

We get it—**real-life is messy**. That’s exactly why **applied anthropologists** are uniquely trained for human-centered work.

We’re not your typical consultants with cookie-cutter playbooks. We’re trained to understand **real human behavior** in all its glitchy, creative, wonderful chaos. Whether it's designing a better employee training or making sure your new platform actually *works* for the people using it, we dig deep—like finding the secret level on your favorite arcade game.

##### What Makes Applied Anthropologists So Effective?

### **We Watch for What People Do, Not What They Say They Do**  

We get it - people are complicated. Sometimes even they aren't concious of their habits or ways of thinking. We learn how people actually think, work, and mess up along the way. That’s how we approach research.  

**Example:** A company thinks everyone is following security protocol… but then we observe someone writing their password on a Post-it and sticking it to their monitor. We look for the real-world behaviors behind the policy screens—because **seeing is understanding**.  

---

### **We Decode Human Culture**  

Every company, team, or community has its own unspoken rules or subculture. We study those rules (spoken and unspoken) so that our strategies actually make sense to the people they’re meant for.  

**Example:** Trying to apply the same training in both a laid-back startup and a high-pressure healthcare org? It's simply not going to work. We tailor the experience to *your* unique culture.  

---

### **We Make Research Findings and Recommendations Interesting**  
We’re not here to deliver boring reports. We turn our findings into **engaging, useful stories and visuals** that help people understand what’s going on and how to improve it.  

**Example:** Instead of just saying, “Users are disengaged,” we’ll say:  
> “Imagine trying to play *Tetris* with invisible blocks. That’s what your onboarding feels like to new employees.”  
Boom. Instant clarity.  

---

### **We Understand You Can't Go It Alone**  
We don’t swoop in, drop some jargon, and disappear. We **work alongside your team** to co-create solutions that are grounded in your actual needs*.  

**Example:** Designing a new workflow? We prototype, test with your team, fix what doesn’t work, and level up together until it feels just right.  

---

### **The Applied Anthropologist Advantage: Leveling Up Human-Centered Design**

We don’t just observe people—we partner with businesses, organizations, and communities to **create real-world solutions** that are as practical as they are people-focused. No guesswork. No off-the-shelf fixes. Just deep insights, co-designed strategies, and outcomes that *actually work* in everyday environments.

**Need to boost your cybersecurity training?** We’ll find the hidden habits, confusion points, and workarounds your team actually uses—then build training they’ll *remember and apply.*  
**Launching a new app or platform?** We’ll help design it with real users in mind, so it feels intuitive, not frustrating—like your favorite classic game that’s easy to pick up, but hard to put down.  
**Rolling out new workplace policies?** We’ll dig into your organizational culture to make sure the rollout fits your people, not just the playbook.

By focusing on **actual human behavior**, cultural dynamics, and collaborative design, applied anthropologists uncover insights that lead to smarter, more effective, and more sustainable outcomes.

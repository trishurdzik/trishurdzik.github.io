### **Alice and Bob Cypher, Support Staff**

Alice and Bob have been instrumental in teaching cycbersecurity and cryptography concepts since 1978. Whether teaching or training, they make it easier for participants to understand complex scenarios in a clear and understandable way, such as secure communication, key exchange, and digital signatures. Alice and Bob were initially introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in their article, "A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems."

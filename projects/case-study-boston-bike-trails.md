## Discovery Research for a Boston Bike Trails App

This case study highlights the critical role of market research in guiding strategic decisions in app development and the potential consequences of not heeding expert recommendations. Read to end for my reflections.

### Background and Scope

I was hired by a tech start-up in Boston to conduct discovery research to assess the market viability of an app designed to show users all the different bike trails in and around the city. The goal was to determine if there was a demand for such an app and identify any unique gaps that the app could fill. 
The start-up requested that the work (proposal, research, analysis, presentation of recommendations) be completed within 4 weeks of the date they contacted me. However, after careful consideration of the project scope and objectives as well as methodologies needed to gather the data needed, I determined that the work could not be done within the time frame they requested. I met with the client again and discussed with them a more realistic timeframe that would ensure they had the data needed in order to make an informed decision on going forward with app development and implementation.  

### Methodologies

The following best-fit methodologies were utilized in order to gather comprehensive insights:
Competitive Analysis
What: I analyzed existing apps that provided information on bike trails in Boston. This included evaluating app features, user reviews, download statistics, and overall market presence.
Why: To understand the current landscape of similar apps available in the market.

### Contextual Analysis

What: I observed how bikers in Boston use current apps and navigational tools during their rides. This included field observations and noting the real-time use of technology on popular bike trails.
Why: To gain a deeper understanding of the biking environment and user interactions with existing solutions.

### Participatory Observation 

What: participated in several biking events and regular bike commutes, engaging with the biking community and observing their behavior and needs.
Why: To experience first-hand the biking culture and the challenges faced by bikers in Boston.

### One-on-One Interviews

What: conducted in-depth interviews with individuals who bike regularly in and around Boston. The questions focused on their current use of apps, pain points, and unmet needs related to biking.
Why: To gather qualitative data from regular bikers about their experiences and needs.

### Findings and Recommendations

Market Saturation: The competitive analysis revealed that the market for bike trail apps in Boston was already saturated with well-established apps offering detailed trail information, real-time updates, and community features.
Lack of Unique Value Proposition: Contextual analysis and participatory observation indicated that existing apps sufficiently met the needs of bikers. There were no significant gaps or unmet needs that a new app could uniquely address.
User Feedback: Interviews with bikers reinforced the findings that the existing apps were highly rated and commonly used. Users did not express a strong desire for additional features that were not already available in current offerings.
Based on the findings above, I reported to the client that entering the market with the bike trail app in its current ideation would likely be unsuccessful. The recommendation was to explore alternative app ideas that could offer a unique value proposition or address an unmet need within the biking community or another target market.

### Client's Decision and Outcome

Despite the well-documented findings and strategic recommendation, the client decided to proceed with the original plan to develop and launch the bike trail app. The app was launched but failed to gain traction in the market. The saturation of similar apps and the lack of differentiation led to poor user adoption and ultimately, the app was not successful.
 
### Reflections

As the consultants’ proverb goes, “you can lead a client to a great recommendation but you can’t make them act on it”. My multi-faceted approach provided clear evidence that the market was not viable for the proposed app. The client decided to proceed against recommendations and this resulted in an unsuccessful product launch. As frustrating as this is when it happens, whether or not the client implements the recommendation(s) is not a reflection of the quality of work performed, nor a personal slight. Because I practice letting go after the work is complete, what the client decides to do with the insights doesn’t affect my sense of worth or pride in my work.

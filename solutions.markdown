<p class="card-text">Research democratization is becoming more and more popular as organizations look to cut costs and cross-train their designers and/or other non-research personnel. In the seminar, workshop, or mentoring session, you'll learn the basics of what is needed to implement a research democratization initiative for non-research UX designers, project managers, etc. This is a great option if you're already familiar with industry standards and best practices, know which methodologies need to be taught and how to do it, and have tasked personnel who are confident in their ability to implementing the initiative across your organization.</p>
<p class="card-text">Have you been tasked with creating and implementing a UX research democratization program but are unsure of where to start or how to continue it? Would you like to Critical Path to be just a phone call or e-mail away? By choosing a consulting retainer, you and your team will have front-of-the-line access to our experts who will answer any and all questions or issues that may arise.</p>
<p class="card-text">Most smaller businesses and start-ups do not have personnel with the bandwidth to implement a project with so many moving parts. If this sounds like your experience, Critical Path specializes in creating and implementing a democratization process specifically for your team. While acting as your Research Ops manager, we'll ensure your team understands industry standards, ethics, how to decide on best-fit methods to allow you to run as lean as possible without sacrificing actionable insights. We'll also introduce guidelines for best practices, documentation, and relaying findings to stakeholders, and so much more!</p>
